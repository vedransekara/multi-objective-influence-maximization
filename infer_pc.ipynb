    "### Identify vulnerable individuals\n",
    "We define vulnerability using two metrics, (1) fraction of times a cascade reached nodes, (2) time (steps) for a cascade to reach a node.\n",

    "__Procedure__\n",
    "1. initialize random network with N nodes\n",
    "2. select n seeds at random\n",
    "3. run spreading process, truncate spread after $t$ steps or after process has run its course (if $p_{\\text{infection}} < 1$)\n",
    "4. identify nodes which arent reached\n",
    "5. repeat process m times\n",
    "6. construct distribution of vulnerability (fraction of time node was not reached)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Spreading dynamics__ - Independent Cascade Model\n",
    "1. At $t=0$ all nodes are inactive, except seed nodes\n",
    "2. Each activated node i contacts all its neighbors j and, with an independent probability p, tries to activate each of those nodes that have been never activated during previous stages of the dynamics\n",
    "3. All nodes that tried to activate their neighbors at step (i) become inactive, and they cannot be activated again in subsequent stages of the dynamics. The process is iterated until no more active nodes are present\n",
    "\n",
    "__How to select $p$?__\n",
    "For a network the critical value $p_c$ separates the region of the phase-diagram where outbreaks are subextensive ($p < p_c$) from the supercritical phase ($p > p_c$) where outbreaks reach a finite fraction of the whole network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of $p_c$ is determined as the position of the maximum of the susceptibility $⟨s^2⟩/⟨s⟩^2$ (where $⟨s^n⟩$ is the n-th moment of the outbreak size distribution computed for random initial single spreaders).\n",
